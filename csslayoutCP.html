<p style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">GOMYCODE was established in 2017 on account of our enthusiasm for the digital world, and to connect the gap that exists between what the standard training offered and what the accessible job offers on the market.

    We have established a genuine network around advanced innovation and we are glad to be pioneers in this field. After opening its doors for the first time in a coworking space, GOMYCODE won the BlooMMasters program in MIT (in 2017) and opened its first hackerspace in Tunis before expanding to Sousse, Sfax, Nabeul, El Menzah V, Beja, Gafsa and Gabes.
    
    During its initial 3 years, GOMYCODE trained more than 10 000 students and set up associations with no less than 100 partners among private and public organizations, colleges and non-administrative associations.
    
    In 2020, GOMYCODE is thinking big and starting its first activities outside of Tunisia. Notably in Algeria, France, Morocco, Egypt, Bahrain, Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire.</p></div>
